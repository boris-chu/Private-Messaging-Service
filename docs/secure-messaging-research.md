# End-to-End Secure Messaging System Research & Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the research findings and architectural recommendations for building a secure, private company messaging application with a terminal-like interface and iMessage-level ease of use.

## üîê Security Architecture Recommendations

### Protocol Choice: Signal Protocol + WebCrypto

**Core Technologies:**
- **Double Ratchet Algorithm**: Provides forward secrecy and post-compromise security
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each message uses unique encryption keys
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Server never has access to message content or keys
- **Quantum Resistance**: Modern implementations include post-quantum cryptography

### Key Security Features

- **ECDH Key Exchange**: Using P-256 curve for initial secure connection
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: For message payload encryption
- **HMAC-SHA256**: For message authentication
- **Ephemeral Keys**: Generated per-session for enhanced security

## üíª Terminal-Like Interface Design

### Connection Flow (SSH-style for Messaging)

```bash
$ secmsg connect user@company.com
> Sending connection request to user@company.com...
> Waiting for acceptance...
> [user@company.com] Connection accepted
> Secure channel established (AES-256, P-256 ECDH)
> Type 'help' for commands

[user@company.com] Hi there!
> Hello! How's the project going?
[user@company.com] Great progress on the API...
```

### Command Interface

```bash
/connect <user@domain>     # Initiate connection request
/accept <user@domain>      # Accept incoming connection
/list                      # Show active connections
/history <user>            # Show message history
/file <path>               # Send encrypted file
/status <message>          # Set status message
/disconnect <user>         # Close connection
/help                      # Show commands
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Options

### Option 1: Minimal WebRTC + Signal Protocol

```
Frontend: Terminal UI (React + xterm.js)
Backend: Node.js + Socket.io
Crypto: WebCrypto API + Signal Protocol
Database: Encrypted SQLite for message storage
Transport: WebRTC for P2P + WebSocket for signaling
```

**Pros:**
- True P2P communication
- Minimal server infrastructure
- Maximum privacy

**Cons:**
- NAT traversal complexity
- Requires STUN/TURN servers

### Option 2: Hybrid Architecture (Recommended)

```
Frontend: Progressive Web App with terminal interface
Backend: Minimal relay server (Go/Rust) + Redis
Crypto: Browser WebCrypto + Signal Protocol implementation
Database: Client-side encrypted storage only
Transport: WebSocket Secure (WSS) + HTTPS
```

**Pros:**
- Simpler deployment
- Works behind corporate firewalls
- Easier maintenance

**Cons:**
- Requires trust in relay server (but messages stay encrypted)

### Option 3: Zero-Trust On-Premise

```
Frontend: Electron app with terminal interface
Backend: Self-hosted server (Docker container)
Crypto: Native crypto libraries + Signal Protocol
Database: Encrypted PostgreSQL for metadata only
Transport: mTLS + WebSocket over VPN
```

**Pros:**
- Complete control
- Audit-friendly
- Regulatory compliance

**Cons:**
- Higher operational overhead
- Requires infrastructure expertise

## üöÄ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Messaging (Week 1-2)
1. Terminal UI with command interface
2. User authentication and key generation
3. Basic ECDH key exchange
4. Simple message encryption/decryption
5. WebSocket connection management

### Phase 2: Security Hardening (Week 3)
1. Signal Protocol implementation
2. Perfect forward secrecy
3. Message integrity verification
4. Secure key storage in browser
5. Connection request/approval system

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Week 4)
1. File transfer with encryption
2. Message history (client-side encrypted)
3. Status indicators and presence
4. Group messaging support
5. Mobile PWA optimization

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations for Private Company

### Must-Have Security Features

- **Client-side encryption only**: Server never sees plaintext
- **Ephemeral messaging**: Auto-delete after configured time
- **Device verification**: Unique device fingerprinting
- **Audit logging**: Encrypted metadata logs for compliance
- **Session management**: Automatic logout and key rotation

### Compliance & Privacy

- **GDPR compliance**: User data control and deletion rights
- **Zero-knowledge design**: Cannot comply with data requests (by design)
- **Regular security audits**: Third-party penetration testing
- **Incident response plan**: Breach notification procedures

## üìä Technology Stack Recommendation

### Frontend (Terminal Interface)
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Terminal UI**: xterm.js for authentic terminal experience
- **Crypto**: WebCrypto API + signal-protocol library
- **Storage**: IndexedDB with encryption
- **PWA**: Service workers for offline capability

### Backend (Minimal Relay)
- **Runtime**: Node.js or Go for performance
- **Transport**: Socket.io or native WebSockets
- **Database**: Redis for session management only
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with short expiry
- **Deployment**: Docker containers + HTTPS/WSS

### DevOps & Security
- **Hosting**: Self-hosted or private cloud
- **SSL/TLS**: Certificate pinning and HSTS
- **Monitoring**: Encrypted logs with anomaly detection
- **Updates**: Automatic security patches
- **Backup**: Encrypted backup strategy

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Choose architecture**: **Option 2 (Hybrid)** recommended for best balance of security, simplicity, and maintainability

2. **Start with MVP**: Terminal interface + basic E2E encryption + user connection system

3. **Security-first development**: Implement crypto before features, regular security reviews

4. **User experience**: Make it as simple as `secmsg connect alice@company.com`

5. **Scale gradually**: Start with 1:1 messaging, then groups, then advanced features

## Research Sources

### Current E2E Messaging Protocols (2025)
- Signal Protocol with Double Ratchet Algorithm
- Matrix Protocol with Olm/Megolm ratchets
- Quantum resistance developments in messaging
- Enterprise solutions: Threema Work, Wire, Troop Messenger

### Web-based E2E Encryption
- WebRTC Insertable Streams for E2E encryption
- WebCrypto API implementations with ECDH
- Browser compatibility and standardization status
- Performance considerations for web applications

### Terminal Interface Messaging
- Modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) renaissance
