## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Repository Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone or create repository
git clone your-repo-url secure-messaging
cd secure-messaging

# 2. Create initial structure
mkdir -p frontend/src workers/src docs
```

### Step 2: Cloudflare Account Setup
```bash
# 1. Sign up for Cloudflare account (free tier)
# 2. Install Wrangler
npm install -g wrangler

# 3. Login
wrangler login

# 4. Get account ID
wrangler whoami
```

### Step 3: First Worker Deployment
```bash
cd workers
wrangler init secure-messaging --yes
echo 'export default { fetch: () => new Response("Hello World") }' > src/index.ts
wrangler deploy
```

### Step 4: First Pages Deployment
```bash
cd frontend
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
npm install
npm run build

# Connect to GitHub and deploy via Cloudflare dashboard
```

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works
- [ ] Worker responds at your-worker.workers.dev
- [ ] Pages site loads at your-pages.pages.dev
- [ ] GitHub integration triggers auto-deploys

cd frontend && npm run dev &
cd workers && wrangler dev &

# 2. Make changes to code
# 3. Test locally
# 4. Commit changes

git add .
git commit -m "Add feature X"
git push origin main

# 5. Verify auto-deployment to staging
# 6. Test on deployed version
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Critical crypto and message handling functions
- **Integration Tests**: WebSocket communication flow
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user scenarios
- **Security Tests**: Encryption/decryption verification

## üéØ **Recommended Starting Point**

**Start with Phase 0, Day 1-2**: Get the basic project structure and GitHub repository set up. This gives you:
1. A place to track progress
2. Working deployment pipeline
3. Foundation for all future development

**Priority order**:
1. ‚úÖ Project structure + GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Cloudflare account + basic deployments
3. ‚úÖ Terminal interface (most visible progress)
4. ‚úÖ WebSocket connection (core functionality)
5. ‚úÖ Basic messaging (proves the concept)
6. ‚úÖ Encryption (makes it secure)

This approach ensures you have working deployments early and can see progress immediately!
