- Frontend integration with Workers
- Git-based deployment workflow
- Cost analysis and performance benefits

### [Security Specifications](./security-specifications.md)
Detailed security requirements, protocols, and enterprise compliance guidelines.

**Contents:**
- Cryptographic specifications (ECDH, AES-256-GCM)
- Authentication and authorization
- Network security requirements
- Threat modeling and attack vectors
- Key management lifecycle
- Incident response procedures

## üéØ Project Goals

Create a secure messaging system that is:
- **Secure**: Enterprise-grade end-to-end encryption
- **Private**: Zero-knowledge architecture
- **Simple**: Easy as iMessage for end users
- **Unique**: Terminal-like interface for technical users
- **Powerful**: Full-featured despite simple architecture

## üèóÔ∏è Recommended Architecture

**Cloudflare-Only Architecture** (Serverless):
```
Frontend: Cloudflare Pages (React + Terminal UI)
Backend: Cloudflare Workers (WebSocket + API)
Database: Durable Objects (Session + Connection Management)
Transport: WebSocket Secure (WSS) + HTTPS
Deployment: Git push ‚Üí Auto-deploy everything
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Read the Research**: Start with [secure-messaging-research.md](./secure-messaging-research.md)
2. **Choose Architecture**: Review [cloudflare-architecture.md](./cloudflare-architecture.md) (recommended)
3. **Follow Implementation**: Use complete Cloudflare Workers implementation
4. **Apply Security**: Implement [security-specifications.md](./security-specifications.md)
5. **Deploy**: `git push` to auto-deploy frontend and backend

## üíª Terminal Interface

The system features a unique terminal-like interface that combines the power of command-line tools with modern web technologies:

```bash
$ secmsg connect user@company.com
> Sending connection request to user@company.com...
> [user@company.com] Connection accepted
> Secure channel established (AES-256, P-256 ECDH)

[user@company.com] Hi there!
> Hello! How's the project going?
```

## üîê Security Highlights

- **Double Ratchet Algorithm**: Forward secrecy and post-compromise security
- **Zero-Knowledge Design**: Server never sees message content
- **WebCrypto API**: Browser-native encryption
- **ECDH Key Exchange**: P-256 curve for secure connections
- **AES-256-GCM**: Message encryption with authentication
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Unique keys per message

## üè¢ Enterprise Features

- **Compliance Ready**: GDPR, HIPAA considerations
- **Audit Logging**: Encrypted metadata logs
- **On-Premise Deployment**: Full control over infrastructure
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, user, guest permissions
- **Multi-Device Support**: Synchronized across devices
- **Incident Response**: Comprehensive security procedures

## üìä Technology Stack

### Frontend (Cloudflare Pages)
- **React** with TypeScript
- **xterm.js** for terminal interface
- **WebCrypto API** for encryption
- **Native WebSockets** for real-time communication

### Backend (Cloudflare Workers)
- **TypeScript** with Workers runtime
- **WebSocketPair API** for WebSocket management
- **Durable Objects** for session/connection management
- **Edge computing** for global deployment

## üîÑ Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core messaging with basic encryption
2. **Phase 2**: Security hardening with Signal Protocol
3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced features and mobile support

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Testing

- **Automated**: Static analysis, dependency scanning
- **Manual**: Penetration testing, code reviews
- **Compliance**: Regular security audits
- **Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection

## üìû Support & Contributing

This documentation provides a complete foundation for implementing a secure messaging system. Each document contains detailed technical specifications and can be used independently or as part of the complete implementation.

For questions about specific implementations or security considerations, refer to the detailed specifications in each document.
